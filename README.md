## Potato Disease Classification

### Overview

The Potato Disease Classification aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different types of diseases based on their visual features. This project is a part of our commitment to advancing computer vision and machine learning techniques. 

### Project Goals
- Train a deep learning model on a dataset of potato leaves images.
- Achieve high accuracy in potato disease classification.
- Deploy the model for real-world potato disease classification applications.

### Project Phases

### 1. Ideation Phase

In this initial phase, our focus will be on brainstorming and gaining insights into the project. We will make use of two essential tools:

#### Empathy Map Canvas: 
The Empathy Map Canvas will enable us to gain deep insights into the perspectives and requirements of our target users, helping us create a user-centered potato disease classification solution.

#### Brainstorming Map: 
The Brainstorming Map will function as a central point for creative thinking, allowing us to explore a wide array of ideas and strategies for the Potato Disease Classification Project.

### 2. Design Phase
In the Design Phase, we will craft a blueprint for our potato disease classification solution. This phase encompasses the following critical elements:

#### Proposed Solution: 
We will define the overall solution for potato disease classification, including framing the problem statement, idea, innovation, societal impact, business model, and scalability.

#### Solution Architecture: 
We will design the technical architecture of our potato disease classification system. This involves decisions regarding infrastructure, such as cloud services or on-premises servers, as well as outlining how various system components will interact, complete with a software diagram.

#### Data Flow Diagram: 
A data flow diagram will depict how data collection, processing, and input into the machine learning model will take place. It will showcase data sources, data processing steps, and the model training and evaluation processes.

### 3. Planning Phase
In the Planning Phase, we will create a plan for our potato disease classification model. This phase will encompass the following key components:

#### Technology Stack: 
In this phase, we will define the technology stack for the potato disease classification project, covering technical architecture, components, technologies, and application characteristics.

#### Project Planning Details: 
This section will focus on the planning aspects of the project, including the product backlog, sprint schedule, project tracker, velocity and burndown chart, board section, backlog section, and project timeline.
